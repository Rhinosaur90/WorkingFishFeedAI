In order to run a trained model turn 'TRAIN' variable to False and change the 'MODELPATH' to the path of your model.pth file

In order to run these files you need to install the requirements.txt so just run the command below in your current conda env
    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

The model will save everytime you get a new highscore and if your highscore is above or around(+-10) 200 then it is a win 
    aka your fish ate 20 fish and the game ended
